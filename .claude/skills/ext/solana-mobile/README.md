# Solana Mobile Dev Skills

Claude Code skills for building Solana Mobile apps.

## Available Skills

### Mobile Wallet Adapter (`mwa/`)

Integrates Mobile Wallet Adapter (MWA) for wallet connection and transaction signing in React Native Expo apps using [@wallet-ui/react-native-web3js](https://wallet-ui.dev/).

All MWA skills are located in the `mwa/` directory:

| Folder | Skill | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `mwa/mobile-wallet-adapter-react-native` | Router | Assesses needs and delegates to sub-skills |
| `mwa/mwa-setup` | Setup | Install dependencies, polyfills, and provider configuration |
| `mwa/mwa-connection` | Connection | Add connect/disconnect wallet functionality |
| `mwa/mwa-transactions` | Transactions | Add SOL transfers and transaction signing |

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Add wallet connection to my React Native app"
- "Integrate Mobile Wallet Adapter"
- "Add a connect wallet button"
- "Send SOL transactions from my app"

### Solana Domains (`skr-address-resolution/`)

Add .skr domain name resolution to display human-readable names instead of wallet addresses.

**What it does:**
- Forward lookup: Resolve `.skr` domains to wallet addresses
- Reverse lookup: Resolve wallet addresses to `.skr` domain names
- Integrates with existing backend or creates minimal Express server

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Add .skr domain resolution to my app"
- "Display .skr names instead of wallet addresses"
- "Show user's .skr name in their profile"

### Seeker Genesis Token (`genesis-token/`)

Verify Seeker device ownership by checking for the Seeker Genesis Token (SGT) — a unique NFT minted once per Seeker device.

**What it does:**
- Proves wallet ownership via Sign-in-with-Solana (SIWS)
- Verifies wallet contains an SGT
- Backend verification to prevent spoofing

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Verify Seeker device ownership"
- "Gate content to Seeker owners"
- "Add SGT verification"
- "Implement anti-Sybil for Seeker"
